## CursorRules: Git Workflow

1. **Stage all your changes**  
   - Quickly stage everything you’ve worked on:  
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

2. **Write a concise commit message**  
   - Keep the title short (ideally ≤ 50 chars).  
   - Begin with a **keyword** that signals the change type, for example:  
     - `feat:` (new feature)  
     - `fix:` (bug fix)  
     - `docs:` (documentation)  
     - `refactor:` (code cleanup)  
     - `test:` (adding/updating tests)  
   - Format:  
     ```bash
     git commit -m "feat: add user-profile endpoint"
     ```

3. **Push to remote**  
   - Send your commit(s) up to GitHub on `master`:  
     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```
